- 👀 I’m interested in the latest iteration of AI, graphic design and relearing how to code most likely starting with python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning photoshop/illustrator/pyton and whatever else catches my attention
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just getting my head around python and how to effectively work with AI
- 📫 How to reach me deuxwolvez on snapchat, deuxwolvez@gmail.com, 5095902301, facebook.com/scotto2316 should get you ahold of me if necessary
